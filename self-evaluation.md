# Self Evaluation

1. How might the `each` method be useful?
> The 'each' method can be useful in many different ways, one such useful use of the 'each' method could be retrieving multiple elements (a specific subset) within the array beyond just '.first' or .last' and method for example. 
> Also, it could be used to getting a random entry from an Array. For example, I have a friend building a program on calling students within a gradeschool classroom that is completely randomized. The each method could be used to randomly choose a student within an array.

2. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
Learning about the many different uses and applications of how the 'each' method could be used, as well as gaining a decent basic understanding of it's use by practice using it. 


3. What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
> Walking through the assignment and code step-by-step and understanding (or guessing beforehand) what exactly the code is supposed to do.
